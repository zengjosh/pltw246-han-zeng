Don't bother eating here unless you want to get physically sick. It has been a couple months since I have gotten the wrong order, cold food, shorted fries, and gotten physically sick from the garbage they gave me (2 bites). I tried to go on their site and file a complaint to let them know about this. Guess what? (A manager will get back to you shortly).... A month later.. "A manage will get back to you"... a few weeks later, "We are escalating your issue please wait another 10 days...". Don't bother, just go anywhere else, but here. Management doesn't care, neither does corporate.
